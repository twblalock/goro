Goro is a simple program that uses goroutines to run multiple arguments concurrently for the same command.

Installation:
`go build goro.go`
Copy or link the binary to a directory in your PATH

Usage: goro -c command arg1 arg2 arg3...
-c="": command to run
-f="": filename containing a newline-separated list of arguments
-n=1: max number of goroutines
-p="": prefix for every argument
-s="": suffix for every argument

Examples:

Echo a list of words
goro -c echo "first" "second" "third"

Echo a list of names from a file
goro -c echo -f names.txt

Curl a url with a different query each time
goro -c "curl -s" -p "http://a.paginated.website.com/?page=" "1" "2" "3" "4"

Curl many urls concurrently (with a maximum of 30 at a time)
goro -c "curl -s" -n 30 -f list_of_urls.txt
