Goro is a simple utility that uses goroutines to run multiple arguments concurrently for the same command.

Installation:
`go build goro.go`
Copy or link the binary to a directory in your PATH

Usage: goro [-n numConcurrent] [-f argFile] [-p prefix] [-s suffix] command [arg1 arg2 arg3...]
-f="": filename containing a newline-separated list of arguments
-n=1: max number of concurrent goroutines
-p="": prefix for every argument
-s="": suffix for every argument

Examples:

Echo a list of words
goro echo "first" "second" "third"

Echo a list of names from a file
goro -f names.txt echo

Curl a url with a different query each time
goro -p "http://a.paginated.website.com/?page=" "curl -s" "1" "2" "3" "4"

Curl many urls concurrently (with a maximum of 30 at a time)
goro -n 30 -f list_of_urls.txt "curl -s"
